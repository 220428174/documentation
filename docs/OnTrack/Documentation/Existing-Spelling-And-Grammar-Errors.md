## Document Purpose

---

The purpose of this document is to act as a list wherein spelling and grammar issues in current
OnTrack documentation can be identified and listed. They can then be subsequently assessed, and if
need be, fixed.

Fixing these spelling and grammar mistakes increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the
documentation in question. This erases the potential for confusion as a result of any erroneous
words or phrases.

## Data Required For Each Entry

---

The following data points are recorded for each entry:

- Document Name
  - The document name allows the reader to understand in which file you have found an error, or
    something that must be checked over.
- Document File Path (in GitHub)
  - Most all of Thoth Tech's documentation can be found in it's GitHub repositories. Including the
    document file path helps the reader find the document quickly, instead of searching through all
    of Thoth Tech's GitHub repositories for it. The reader could instead follow this file path to
    identify where the document is that you are referring to. For example, the OnTrack Documentation
    Template can be found at: _documentation/docs/OnTrack/Documentation_.
- Erroneous Words/Phrases
  - Listing the erroneous words or phrases your entry refers to informs the reader as to where the
    problems are in the document.
- Corrective Suggestions
  - Listing these indicates to your reader why you think the mentioned words and/or phrases must be
    changed. They can then take these suggestions into consideration when proofreading the document.

## How This Document Is Formatted:

---

Entries into this document are made through the use of tables written in Markdown. The table appears
as shown below:

| Document Name | Document File Path (in GitHub) | Erroneous Words/Phrases              | Corrective Suggestions                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Example-1"   | documents/Example-1            | "...their is a document called..."   | In this context, "there" should be used instead of "their" |
| "Example-2"   | documents/Example-2            | "... When's the meeeting today? ..." | "Meeting" is spelt incorrectly.                            |

For further information on Markdown, what it is and how to use it, Thoth Tech has a
[Markdown Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/learning/training/markdown-guide.md).

### Adding A New Entry

---

To add an entry to an existing table, each bit of data you enter should be separated by a '|'. For
example, the first entry of the above table, in Markdown, is therefore written like this:

> | "Example-1" | documents/Example-1 | "...their is a document called..." | In this context,
> "there" should be used instead of "their". |

As you can see, each column's data in the entry is separated by a "|". A "|" is also needed on each
end of the table as well. In the above example, this is before "Example-1" and after "Meeting is
spelt incorrectly".

### Important Considerations When **_Making New Additions_** To This Document

---

- To save readers having to go in between many different files when looking through this list,
  _order entries by document_.
- Tables written in Markdown do not allow dot points in their data. Therefore, if more than one
  corrective suggestion is written, these may must be numbered to help the reader differentiate
  them. For example: 1. First suggestion. 2. Second suggestion.
- Where corrective suggestions are small changes, for example, the changing of one
  letter/character), highlighting the changes in your suggestions may better help readers understand
  them. This can be done through the use of italics or bold text.
  - _Italics_ can be written by including one asterisk ("\*") on either side of the text you wish to
    be in italics.
  - **Bold** text can be written by including two asterisks ("\*\*") on either side of the text you
    wish to be in bold.
- Ensure entries are written so that any reader, regardless of their level of contextual knowledge,
  could understand what your suggestions mean.
- Thoth Tech uses a **set of rules** when **writing documentation**. The
  [Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/documentation/writing-style-guide.md)
  outlines these.
- Thoth Tech also uses the tools "Prettier" and "Vale" for **writing documentation**. Thoth Tech has
  an
  [Installation Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/learning/useful-resources/setup-prettier-and-vale.md)
  for both of these technologies.

### Important Considerations When **_Fixing Items_** In This List:

---

- Always check with the relevant team/company area **BEFORE** editing work done by them. _What one
  person might believe is incorrect, might in fact be correct in the context of the document where
  it is found._ For example, the "Juypter" in the "Jupyter Notebook" file type might be perceived as
  being an incorrectly spelt version of the more common "Jupiter". However, in this context, the
  name of the file type is indeed "**Jupyter** Notebook", and should be written as such.
- Once an error is fixed and verified as correct, delete it from this list.
