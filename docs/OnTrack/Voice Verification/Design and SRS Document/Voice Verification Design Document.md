## Delivery Description

---

OnTrack as a platform allows for students to track assessments for enrolled subjects, and submit
their work once completed. Audio submissions have been a substitute for in-person discussions in
recent years.

The OnTrack Voice Verification system aims to verify audio submissions, to ensure that the speaker
in the submission is the correct student.

This system would be implemented inside the existing OnTrack Project, and integrated into OnTrack by
using the pre-existing audio submission system.

## Problem Statement

---

When submitting an assessment with an oral component, the student may take advantage of the OnTrack
audio submissions system.

However, any audio file may be submitted through this system; it is not verified at any stage in the
current OnTrack implementation. Contract cheating or other methods of cheating could be used, and
would not be picked up by the system automatically.

A possible method to cheat by taking advantage of the pre-existing system would be to pay someone
else to answer audio questions. As no verification process is taking place, tutors may not identify
that the person speaking is not the student who is being assessed.

A verification system for testing audio submissions against a baseline audio sample would make this
type of cheating more difficult.

The voice verification system would give a confidence in the speakers identity, which could then be
verified by an assessor if necessary.

As such, this allows for greater verification of submissions, and ensuring that cheating using the
audio submission system can be minimised.

## Current Works

---

The current voice verification system is not linked to the OnTrack architecture. Instead, the system
is implemented as a Docker Container, that can accept audio inputs, and produces a confidence
variable with certainty of the speakers identity.

At this stage, the system receives a known sample, and a new audio file. These must be manually
submitted to the container through the CLI.

As such, a system to link the existing Docker container to the OnTrack system must be implemented
for automatic verification and display of results.

## Design

---

The Design of the voice verification interaction should be handled through the message queue OnTrack
utilises, OnTrack Overseer.

When an audio file is sent through the OnTrack Overseer message queue, the file may be validated
against the baseline file collected for that student. Then, the confidence value appended to the
message on the message queue. This can then be later sent off to the assessor alongside the audio
submission using the OnTrack Overseer message queue.

### Architecture

### User Interaction

Ideally, students wont no interaction with the verification system. Once an audio file has been
submitted, it is automatically be queued for verification. Once verified, the assessor can listen to
the audio submission, and view the confidence value.

### Testing

Testing for the implemented system would must include the following strategies:

- Validation of files with the same speakers.
- Verification of files with different speakers.
- Verification of files with multiple different speakers.
- Verification of files with no speakers.

Additionally, other methods of bypassing the system should be investigated. This would include
testing database security; more specifically where the validation results are stored.

Finally, testing different values for confidence thresholds would allow for more refined use of the
voice verification system.

## Success metrics

---

To measure the success of the system, a Confusion Matrix should be generated to determine the false
positive and false negative rate of the system. As results would be validated by an assessor, this
information can be tracked per assessor, and collated for review.
