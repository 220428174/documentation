*Design 1 - Organisational Hierarchy*

One challenge that may be faced by new members of any organisation, is identifying who they can reach out to with specific questions or general advice. It is for this reason that the design team has developed a wireframe to represent the members of Thoth Tech, their position in the chain and the deliverables they are responsible for. 

This can help reduce queries being sent to persons not knowledgeable about a project, reducing the instances of conversations being forwarded and can keep turnaround times for feedback and advice low. This wireframe can be obtained by opening the file titled ‘Hierarchy.png’.














*Design 2 - Pop Up Contact Information*

The second design provided for the late semester sprint, is that of a pop up menu which can present the contact information, availability matrix, campus location, time zone and availability status of any given organization member. A custom status can be made which can provide specific information a student or colleague may often reach out to this individual for. This was designed as an extension of (to be deployed within), the organisational hierarchy.

The design draws information from systems used in Zoom and Microsoft teams, the design team feels this wireframe can be used to develop a concise and clear module for accessing vital contact and availability information for team members and delivery leads or directors. See ‘Contact\_Information.png for more info.

















*Design 3 -  Upload and Download Modules*

Through researching the finalised and approved user stories, it was clearly identified that centralised locations for accessing files uploaded to the website was essential. It was also clear that a standardised and easy-to-use upload module needed to be available. Supported file types have been provided as an example within the context of progress made this semester, more formats can be added in the future.

Within the ‘UP\_DOWN.png’ sample pages have been provided for what this could look like in the context of the website for the company. The bottom left of the file activity wireframe shows sync status’, referencing the desire to implement cloud-based hosting to support sharing of files and resources across multiple devices with ease.
















*Design 4 - Resource Management (Leaders)*

Another standout user stories which guided efforts of the design team, was the needs of product leads and how these could be presented within the website to support progress and effective management of tasks and team members. There are a number of features and embedded links which are used to enhance the experience of product/delivery leads within Thoth Tech.

‘Management.png’ demonstrates a storage location for meeting minutes. This is intentionally separate from other contributions so they can be easily accessed for standups, demonstrations and handovers. The middle hyperlink shows a ‘manage your team’ style link, which will lead to a restricted access version of design 1’s organisational hierarchy. From within this module a number of items can be attended to. From assigning tasks & deadlines, to scheduling meetings and checking onboarding progress, this module will make for a more streamlined experience start-to-finish for individuals in management style positions. 













*Design 5 - Centralised Onboarding*

One aspect of commencing the capstone program which can be challenging or confusing for new students, is having all organisations in the same Microsoft teams channel providing their onboarding information in the same place. It was through consideration and reflection of these challenges in user stories, that the template design was made to provide clear, separated links and brief summaries of the different teams and their projects within the website.

Through this, students can read about the different projects underway within a company, as well as reading about the company itself. This wireframe and following development could also be expanded to include a feedback module, where suggestions about new projects or innovations could be provided and passed on to relevant leaders of a given team or project. This can be viewed by opening ‘Onboard.png’
















*Design 6 - Previous Content Archive*

The final wireframe delivered within the sprint, was that of a design for content archiving. The focus for students should be about what they can contribute for the semester and managing their workloads respectively. However, having access to resources created past semester, such as wireframes, code contributions and handover documents cannot be underestimated.

It is for this reason that the design team has created a template which could be used in the website to separate prior content, divided into the relevant trimesters. On the right hand side of the design, hyperlinks to redirect to specific projects within the company have been provided, in case a student accidentally accesses the wrong tasks. This avoids the need to create a different web page for each project, simultaneously reducing the amount of resources needed to keep the website and its various implemented features online.
