# Gatsby Starter Guide
Gastby is static site generator based on react. To boost performance, GatsbyJS loads only critical HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other data. Once loaded, it prefetches resources for other pages you might navigate to. This way, your site loads as fast as possible and user interactions feel seamless. 

The main thing about our project and Gatsby is that we are using no database and no server side code. Now, to use gatsby you need understanding of ReactJS and JavaScript. The videos down below gives a good overview of react.

Just understanding the basics of react should be enough to start using GatsbyJS. The main focus should be how the functionional components work. We will be creating our website in components as well and and then putting it all together.

For GatsbyJS this video is helpful to get fundamentals down.

The structure of the code is very simple. You have two folders inside the src directory:  `images`, and `pages`. The images directory contains image used for the site. Further we need to create components folder inside src to house all the components we are going to build in this app

These components work in `index.js` in the `pages` directory. You call these components inside the index.js.
 
 More about this is explained in the github repo.
