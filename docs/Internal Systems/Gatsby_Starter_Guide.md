# Gatsby Starter Guide

Gatsby is static site generator based on react. To boost performance, GatsbyJS loads only critical
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other data. Once loaded, it prefetches resources for other pages you
might navigate to. This way, your site loads as fast as possible and user interactions feel
seamless.

The main thing about our project and Gatsby is that we are using no database and no server side
code. Now, to use Gatsby you need understanding of ReactJS and JavaScript. The videos down below
gives a good overview of react.

Just understanding the basics of react should be enough to start using GatsbyJS. The main focus
should be how the functional components work. We will be creating our website in components as well
and then putting it all together.

For GatsbyJS, the following video is helpful to get fundamentals down.

There are two folders inside the `src` directory: `images`, and `pages`. The `images` directory
contains image used for the site. Further we need to create components folder inside `src` to house
all the components we are going to build in this app.

These components work in `index.js` in the `pages` directory. We call these components inside the
`index.js`.

More about this is explained in the
