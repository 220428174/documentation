# Week 5 To-Do

## Prioritise & Reflect

We're in the swing of it now. This week, we're focusing on the priority tasks that Ishrat listed in the post above. These are:

- onboarding plus reaching out to product leads to update product pages in the Handbook (Faiq)
- company operations (Sarah)
- getting started guide (Ethan)

We will also have our first retro during next week's team meeting.

1. Whatever task you are working on, complete your Trello card (or add yourself to the existing card) first and fill out all the template headings.
2. If you're creating or editing content in the Handbook, you can request a review from me in GitHub as you do parts, no need to wait until it's all finished.
3. Check out the Whiteboard tab (above) and add a few cards under each heading thinking about what we have achieved so far, and how we have worked as a team. We will discuss this together next week.

See you next Tuesday!
