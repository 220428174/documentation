# Week 10 To-Do

## Pull it all together

Hi Company Documentation
The focus this week and next will be on wrapping everything up, reflecting on our achievements and setting next trimester's team up for success. In tonight's meeting we agreed:

1. Sarah will put together a shared document in this channel that everyone should contribute to.
2. Everyone will use Sarah's document to to list out all of our achievements this trimester.
3. Ethan will take the information from this document and update our project's report, ready for inclusion in the Company Report (Task 10.2P). ETHAN, can you please use the subheading Project End-Trimester Progress and document our progress this trimester underneath that?
4. Everyone make sure you submit Task 10.1P with plenty of time to spare, look out for your feedback and resubmit if needed. You will also need to create your portfolio in OnTrack after that task has been marked as Complete.
5. Everyone update Company Documentation | Trello with all task statuses, and any useful resources that will help next trimester's students hit the ground running.

Thank you all for your work.
Next week will be our final weekly team meeting, it would be great to see everyone there!
